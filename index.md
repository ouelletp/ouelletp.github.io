This summer, Paxton will be conducting research through Schaffer Library to explore the idea of power by creating a digital scholarly edition of the diaries of Jonathan Pearson (1813-87), a Union student, professor, librarian, treasurer, and trustee.  This experience will enable exploration of the digital humanities, including digitization, digital publishing, scholarly editing, archival research, and computational text analysis and will be of much aid as she embarks on her senior theses in political science and history this upcoming year.
  
In her thesies, Paxton will focus on the creation of the two party system and the impact it played on the Civil War and the changing attitudes within the United States towards Asian Americans following the end of the Second World War and the rise of Communism in Asia.
